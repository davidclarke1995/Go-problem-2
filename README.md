# Go-problem-2
The second sheet for Go 

To clone the repository, copy https://github.com/davidclarke1995/Go-problem-2.git and open the command prompt and paste it into it after git clone. Inside I have the solutions for the 8 Go problems working as best as I can. At the top of each problem is the URL for websites that I have extracted code snippets and used information.
